Navigate to "Wallet Settings" in your dashboard 2. Click "Add New Wallet" 3. Select the blockchain type 4. Enter your wallet address or connect via Web3 wallet extension 5.

The old contract will remain active but won't receive new tips. ## Default Payment Method - Set your preferred blockchain as the default payment option - This currency will be highlighted when supporters visit your tip page - You can change your default payment method at any time ## Next Steps - Return to [Getting Started](getting-started.md) - Learn about [Button Setup](button-setup.md) - Check our [FAQ](faq.md) for common questions </doc>
<doc title="FAQ" desc="Answers to common questions."># Frequently Asked Questions ## General Questions ### What is Tip.md? Tip.md is a platform that allows content creators to receive cryptocurrency tips directly to their wallets via a simple button that can be embedded in GitHub READMEs, websites, or any markdown content. ### How much does Tip.md cost to use? Tip.md charges a flat 4% fee on all tips received. There are no subscription fees or hidden charges. For Ethereum tips using Splits.org integration, additional fees from Splits.org may apply. ### Which cryptocurrencies are supported? Currently, Tip.md supports Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Bitcoin via the Lightning Network. We're continuously evaluating additional blockchains to add in the future. ## Account and Setup ### Do I need a cryptocurrency wallet to use Tip.md? Yes, you need at least one cryptocurrency wallet address to receive tips. You can add addresses for Ethereum, Solana, or Bitcoin Lightning Network. ### Can I use multiple wallet addresses? Yes, you can add multiple wallet addresses for each supported blockchain. Tips will be sent to the address you've designated for that particular cryptocurrency. ### How do I change my wallet address? Go to "Wallet Settings" in your dashboard, find the wallet you wish to update, click "Edit," make your changes, and save. All future tips will go to the updated address. ## Button and Integration ### Can I customize how my tip button looks? Yes, you can customize the size, text, and default currency displayed on your button using parameters in the button URL. ### Where can I add my Tip.md button? You can add your button to GitHub READMEs, personal websites, blogs, or any platform that supports markdown or HTML embedding. ### Does my audience need a Tip.md account to tip me? No, tippers don't need to create an account. They simply need a cryptocurrency wallet with the supported cryptocurrencies to send tips. ## Transactions and Fees ### How quickly will I receive tips? Tips are sent directly to your wallet, so the speed depends on the blockchain used. Ethereum transactions typically take a few minutes, Solana transactions are nearly instant, and Lightning Network tips are immediate. ### Who pays the transaction fees? The person sending the tip (tipper) pays any blockchain transaction fees (gas fees for Ethereum, etc.). ### Is there a minimum tip amount? There's no platform-enforced minimum, but due to blockchain transaction fees, very small tips may not be practical on certain networks (particularly Ethereum during high gas price periods). ## Security and Privacy ### Does Tip.md hold my funds at any point? No, Tip.md never holds your cryptocurrency. All transactions happen directly between the tipper's wallet and your wallet. ### Is my wallet address visible to others? Your wallet address is visible to anyone who sends you a tip, as it's necessary for the transaction. However, it's not publicly displayed on your profile unless you choose to share it. ### How secure is Tip.md? Tip.md uses client-side transactions for maximum security. We never handle or store private keys. All sensitive data is encrypted, and we follow industry best practices for web security. ## Technical Support ### What should I do if a tip doesn't arrive? First, check the transaction on a blockchain explorer using the transaction ID. If the transaction was confirmed but you don't see the funds, verify your wallet address in your settings. For unresolved issues, contact support@tip.md. ### Can I use Tip.md with hardware wallets? Yes, you can add any valid wallet address to your Tip.md account, including addresses from hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor. ### Where can I get additional help? For technical support, email support@tip.md.
